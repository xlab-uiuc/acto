                                      data will be restored to the volume at the same
                                      time. If the provisioner does not support VolumeSnapshot
                                      data source, volume will not be created and
                                      the failure will be reported as an event. In
                                      the future, we plan to support more data source
                                      types and the behavior of the provisioner may
                                      change.

                                  The command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside
                                  a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|',
                                  etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly
                                  call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated
                                  as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.
