# This sample adds a Secret to reference from an InnoDBCluster manifest.
# It's used to create a privileged MySQL user, a user used by a sysadmin to manage the cluster.
# Although typically named "root", it can be a different name.
# Note: MySQL Operator creates additional (internal) Secrets and MySQL users.
