## Known Issues
- ([A Known Issue of Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files)) Failed cluster creation when using the multiple worker functionality by specifying `--num-workers`.

  This may be caused by running out of inotify resources. Resource limits are defined by fs.inotify.max_user_watches and fs.inotify.max_user_instances system variables. For example, in Ubuntu these default to 8192 and 128 respectively, which is not enough to create a cluster with many nodes.
  
  To increase these limits temporarily, run the following commands on the host:
  ```shell
  sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
  sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=512
  ```
  To make the changes persistent, edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and add these lines:
  ```shell
  fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
  fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 512
  ```

## Example:   
**rabbitmq-operator**:  
```console
python3 acto.py --seed data/rabbitmq-operator/config.json
                --num-workers 4
```

## Porting operators
Acto aims to automate the E2E testing as much as possible to minimize users' labor.

Currently, porting operators still requires some manual effort, we need:
1. A way to deploy the operator, the deployment method needs to handle all the necessary prerequisites to deploy the operator, e.g. CRD, namespace creation, RBAC, etc. Current we support three deploy methods: `yaml`, `helm`, and `kustomize`. For example, rabbitmq-operator uses `yaml` for deployment, and the [example is shown here](data/rabbitmq-operator/operator.yaml)
2. A seed CR yaml serving as the initial cr input. This can be any valid CR for your application. [Example](data/rabbitmq-operator/cr.yaml)

## Running Acto on good machines
Acto supports multi-cluster parallelism, which in theory makes Acto scale perfectly.
However, it turns out to be not that perfect when I tried to run Acto on a CloudLab 220-g5 machine.

The machine has 40 cores, 192 GB RAM, and a 500 GB SSD. I tried to run Acto with 8 clusters, and all
of them failed, because it takes the operators more than 5 minutes to get ready. Every cluster becomes
extremely slow, liveness probe fails very often causing pods being recreated all the time. I found
out that Acto is IO-bound, meaning the performance is bottled-necked by the speed of disk READ/WRITE.

We usually have 2 GB of images to preload into each cluster node, and we have 4 nodes for each cluster.
With 8 clusters, it means the machine needs to preload ~20GB * 8 content to the disk, and then read
some of them into memory to start running 4 * 8 Kubernetes. During all this time, CPU and memory are
moslty idle and SSD is at full-load all the time.

To mitigate this issue, there are two directions:
1. Reduce the size of the preload images
  - There are some redundent images in the image archive, we can remove them
  - Reduce the number of nodes in the cluster
  - Switch to k3s, which is a lightweight version of k8s
2. Mount docker's workdir in tmpfs on the RAM
  - Since we have 192 GB RAM on the machine, we can put docker's workdir in RAM to avoid the IO
  bottleneck
