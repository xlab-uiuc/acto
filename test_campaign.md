# Running test campaigns for each operator

We provide the scripts to run the test campaigns for each operator below.

If you are going to run multiple test campaigns serially on one machine, you will have to do the following between runs for a cleanup:

```sh
bash scripts/teardown.sh
```

```sh
python3 -m acto \
        --config data/cass-operator/config.json \
        --num-workers 16 \
        --workdir testrun-cass
