# Drain

Drain is an online log parser that can parse logs into structured events in a streaming and timely manner. It employs
a parse tree with fixed depth to guide the log group search process, which effectively avoids constructing a very deep and unbalanced tree.

Researchers from IBM made an upgrade version of Drain in Python 3.6 with additional features: [https://github.com/IBM/Drain3](https://github.com/IBM/Drain3)
